## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- MongoDB instance
- AMap JS API key & secret
- Tencent Maps API key
- Sentry

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naptie/nearcade.git
   cd nearcade
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   PUBLIC_AMAP_KEY = "your_key"
   PUBLIC_QQMAP_KEY = "your_key"
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN = "https://example.ingest.de.sentry.io/"

   AMAP_SECRET = "your_secret"
   MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/?dbName=nearcade"
   ```

   Additionally, if you need to generate a static build, set the `PUBLIC_API_BASE` environment variable (and delete all `+page.server.ts` files); if you want to publish a Sentry release or upload source maps to Sentry, set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

4. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm build

# Preview the production build
pnpm preview
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
ADAPTER=cloudflare pnpm cf-deploy
```

## üö¢ Running with Docker

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed on your machine (follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
- **Docker Compose** (for multi-container setups, if needed).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naptie/nearcade.git
   cd nearcade
   ```

2. **Build the Docker images:**

   Make sure that both `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are in the root directory of your project.

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Ensure that you have the required environment variables set. You can create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following content:

   ```env
   PUBLIC_AMAP_KEY = "your_key"
   PUBLIC_QQMAP_KEY = "your_key"
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN = "https://example.ingest.de.sentry.io/"

   AMAP_SECRET = "your_secret"
   MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/?dbName=nearcade"
   ```

   **Note:** If you're using Docker Compose to run the app and MongoDB together, you may need to modify `MONGODB_URI` to point to the MongoDB container instead of `localhost`.

4. **Start the application using Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start both the application and any dependencies, like MongoDB, that you have defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. **Access the application:**

   Once the containers are up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

### Stopping the Docker Containers

To stop the Docker containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
